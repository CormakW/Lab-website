**Postdoctoral researchers:** We are always excited to have creative and hardworking people join our team. Expertise in microfluidics/fluid dynamics, imaging and image analysis, rheology, or soft materials processing/characterization is required. To apply, send us a cover letter describing your background and future research interests, a curriculum vitae, and the contact details of at least two references. Currently, candidates with external funding are preferred.

**Graduate students:** If you are a graduate student (in any department at North Carolina State University) interested in rotating in or joining the lab, send us a brief description of your background and research interests, and some times to meet. If you are a graduate student at another institution, you may be able to do a short-term internship in our lab if you have external funding; send us a brief description of your background and research interests, as well as the contact details of your primary research advisor. Currently, candidates with external funding are preferred.

**Undergraduate students:** If you are a junior or senior at NCSU interested in doing thesis work in the lab, a freshman or sophomore in, or if you would like to do Federal Work-Study research in the lab, get in touch! If you are a student at another institution, you may be able to work in our lab if you have funding (such as through an REU program or external fellowship). Either way, you don't need to have any prior research experience: just be curious and eager to learn! Send us an email briefly describing your background and interests, how much time you would like to spend in the lab, and what you hope to get out of your research experience.

**High-school students:** If you are curious and eager to learn, you are more than welcome to spend time in our lab! Send us an email briefly describing your interests, how much time you would like to spend in the lab, and what you hope to get out of your research experience. Also, please take a look at the Laboratory Learning Program.
