**The Wadhwa lab** opened its doors in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/research/centers/mechanisms-evolution){:target="_blank"} at Arizona State University in August 2022! We study mechanical interactions between bacterial cells and their environment as well as the intracellular signaling processes that enable bacteria to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.

We are actively recruiting awesome scientists to help grow our team and our research program. We welcome you to browse our website and get in touch if interested in joining us. [Click here](/join){:target="_blank"} to get started.
