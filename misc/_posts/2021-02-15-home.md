**Welcome to the Hsiao Lab at NCSU!**

Our group’s research interests are in the areas of soft materials and complex fluids – specifically on the use of shaped colloids and functionalized polymer surfaces. We specialize in using microscopy and rheology to identify the frameworks used to engineer the mechanical properties of soft surfaces. Our work can be applied to many fields: understanding of nanoscale forces in non-spherical particulate systems, revealing the biomechanics of lubricated joints that make movement possible, and developing new types of materials with directional properties that are not found in nature. We use an interdisciplinary approach that combines experiments and models from materials science, chemical engineering, physics, and mechanical engineering to understand the roles of structure and dynamics in these systems.
