# Abstract 

We report the effect of flow-induced dynamical heterogeneity on the nonlinear elastic modulus of weakly aggregated colloidal gels that have undergone yielding by an imposed step strain deformation. The gels are comprised of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) colloids interacting through short-ranged depletion attractions. When a step strain of magnitude varying from Î³ = 0.1 to 80.0 is applied to the quiescent gels, we observe the development of a bimodal distribution in the single-particle van Hove self-correlation function. This distribution is consistent with the existence of a fast and slow subpopulation of colloids within sheared gels. We evaluate the effect of incorporating the properties of the slow, rigid subpopulation of the colloids into a recent mode coupling theory for the nonlinear elasticity of colloidal gels.
