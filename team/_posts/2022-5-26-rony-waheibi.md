I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. My work looks at the fundamental interactions of colloidal suspensions and soft matter systems using idealized experimental models. I am currently working towards understanding the impact of size anisotropy on colloidal gels and its potential for modifying the underlying microstructure that propagates to its macroscopic properties.
