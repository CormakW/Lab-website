I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I earned my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in May 2022 and subsequently transitioned to the Ph.D. program at NC State University in August of the same year. My research is centered around the development of hydrogel-based tactile sensors for applications in wearable devices.
