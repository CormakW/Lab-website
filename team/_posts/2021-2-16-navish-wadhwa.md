I am an [antedisciplinary scientist](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010006){:target="_blank"} broadly interested in problems involving and at the intersection of bacterial motility, mechanobiology, and fluid mechanics. To this end, I combine tools and concepts from physics and biology to gain fresh insights into problems at the interface of these fields. Recent work includes studies of the bacterial flagellar motor, plankton hydrodynamics, and interfacial phenomena.
