I am an incoming graduate student in the Biological Design Graduate program. I am interested in understanding the molecular basis of bacterial phenotypes. During my master's research I have worked on molecular and protein structural biology. Through my research, I aim to establish a link between how changes at the structural level manifest at the level of the cell's behavior, using a bacterial model system.
