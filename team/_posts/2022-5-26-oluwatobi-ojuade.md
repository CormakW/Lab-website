I am a graduate student in the chemical engineering PhD program. I take a bioinspired approach to understanding interfacial tribology and the force interactions present on the contacting surfaces. I am interested in developing materials that perform efficiently in lubricated environments at high sliding speeds and furthering the understanding of wet friction.
