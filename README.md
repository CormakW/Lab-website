# The Wadhwa Lab main website

Our website, http://wadhwalab.com, is a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com), originally pulled from [D. Allan Drummond's website](https://drummondlab.org/).

What follows is a basic guide to making modifications to the site, focused on adding typical content.

# Prerequisites

 You will need working knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}, [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax){:target="_blank"}, [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/){:target="_blank"}, and (possibly) a few basic [Unix commands](https://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html){:target="_blank"}. You will need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (which in turn requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)  and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)). If you need help getting set up, ask someone who is already up and running.

To execute Git and Unix commands on your computer, you will need a terminal (aka command prompt, command shell, and command line). Here are some options:

- For macOS:
	- Built-in Terminal. Press âŒ˜ command + space and type terminal.
	- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), which can be integrated with [Zsh and Oh My Zsh](https://medium.com/ayuth/iterm2-zsh-oh-my-zsh-the-most-power-full-of-terminal-on-macos-bdb2823fb04c) for some great features.
- For Windows:
	- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), integrated with [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) for some great features.
	- Git Bash. It is built into [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- For Linux users:
	- [Built-in Linux Terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal)

If you have all the software installed and a basic knowledge of the tools, it is time to get started!

## Clone the repository

If you're a member of the [Drummond Lab team](https://github.com/orgs/drummondlab/teams/drummond-lab-team), you have access to the website repository.

To clone the repository, making a local copy on your machine:

	git clone git@github.com:drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io

Enter your local repository and check out the `staging` branch, where you'll make changes before promoting them to the `master` branch and publishing them:

	cd drummondlab.github.io
	git checkout staging

## Overview of the structure

Let's assume you're familiar with HTML pages. A site is a collection of HTML pages. For our site (and many others), there are page types, like a paper page, or a lab member page, which are the same in design but different in content. In the web-accessible site, these are indeed different pages. However, as you might hope, they are _generated_ from a single template file filled in with information from many paper- or member-specific data files. This generation is done every time the site changes; it's handled by GitHub Pages, the service we use.

The template files are weird-looking HTML files residing in the `_includes/themes/lab` folder.

## How to add content

For most common actions---adding a lab member, paper, protocol, or news item---you'll be making a new Markdown file in the proper location, naming it properly, and filling in the required fields. In almost all cases, you can (and should!) copy an existing item, change the name, and change its content, rather than trying to write a Markdown document from scratch.

For example, suppose you want to add a news item, which will appear on the front page, announcing that you have created a yeast strain capable of secreting high-quality chardonnay. Go into the `news/_posts` folder. Copy one of the existing items into a new file named with today's date (it matters!) and a brief title:

	cp 2017-12-15-allan-tenure.md 2020-01-31-wine-yeast.md

The date is used by the generator; it's inelegant and perhaps there's a way to do it differently, but that's how it is for now. Now edit the new file to make the content what you want. Just open it in your favorite editor and type away. By the time you're done, hopefully you have something like this:

	---
	layout: news
	title: "New yeast strain makes chardonnay"
	author: "X. Obsequious Trenchant"
	author_handle: "xot"
	image: /assets/images/news/default-news.png
	category: news
	tags: [breakthrough]
	---
	Today we are thrilled to announce a new strain of yeast that secretes beautifully oaked chardonnay. See more details in our [preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/0000000)!

Now add it to the repository:

	git add 2020-01-31-wine-yeast.md

And, when you're happy with it, commit and push:

	git commit -m "announcing new yeast strain"
	git push

This new announcement won't yet be public. The next section shows you how to do that.

The same basic process is used to add protocols, team members, etc.

## Updating the public site

All edits should be made on the `staging` branch. When you start work, make sure you're on the staging branch:

	git checkout staging

Once your edits are done, preview the site. Generate the pages and start the private webserver:

	rake preview

...and then open the local test site, http://127.0.0.1:4000. Look at anything you've changed and make sure it's good to go.

Then move the changes to the `master` branch:

	git checkout master
	git merge staging

and push to GitHub:

	git push

Changes won't be immediate, so wait a minute or two while GitHub's servers regenerate the site and publish it. Check to make sure the public site http://drummondlab.org looks the way you intend.

Finally, check out `staging` again so that you don't accidentally start working on the `master` branch the next time you sit down:

	git checkout staging

## Changing look and feel

Fonts, colors, spacing, and similar stylings are separate from the template pages. Like most sites, we use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
